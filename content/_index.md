description: "I am a sociologist who studies the political consequences of economic inequality. My research investigates how the dramatic growth in income and wealth inequality in industrialized countries since the 1980s has shaped political life in three key areas: identity, voting, and social welfare. This scholarship contributes to research in political sociology, inequality and stratification, social policy, and the study of nationalism, populism, and the far right in multiple disciplines."
