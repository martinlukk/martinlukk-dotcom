description: "I am a sociologist who studies the political consequences of economic inequality. My research investigates how the dramatic growth in income and wealth inequality in industrialized countries since the 1980s has shaped political life in three key areas: identity, voting, and social welfare. This work contributes to scholarship in  political sociology, digital sociology, inequality and stratification, social policy, race and ethnicity, and health and illness.

<br><br>I am an author of the forthcoming book [_GoFailMe: The Unfulfilled Promise of Digital Crowdfunding_](https://www.amazon.com/GoFailMe-Unfulfilled-Promise-Digital-Crowdfunding/dp/1503609049/)  (Stanford University Press, September 2023), written with Erik Schneiderhan."
