description: 'I am a sociologist studying <span style="color:#2c2857; font-style:italic;">politics, inequality,</span> and <span style="color:#2c2857; font-style:italic;">the internet.</span> I am particularly interested in how income inequality shapes political identities and the role of digital technologies in social welfare. My work contributes to scholarship in political sociology, digital sociology, inequality and stratification, social policy, and health and illness.

<br><br>I recently published the article ["Politics of Boundary Consolidation: Income Inequality, Ethnonationalism, and Radical-Right Voting"](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231241251714) in _Socius._

<br><br>I am an author of the book [_GoFailMe: The Unfulfilled Promise of Digital Crowdfunding_](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=30793) (2023, Stanford University Press). I recently published an op-ed about this research in [_The Conversation._](https://theconversation.com/what-gofundme-conceals-the-campaigns-that-fail-234336)<br><br>'
