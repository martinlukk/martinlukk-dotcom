description: 'I am a sociologist studying <span style="color:#2c2857; font-style:italic;">politics, inequality,</span> and <span style="color:#2c2857; font-style:italic;">the internet.</span> I am particularly interested in how cultural divisions become sources of political conflict and how digital platforms enable and constrain pro-social behavior online.

<br><br>I recently published the article ["Politics of Boundary Consolidation: Income Inequality, Ethnonationalism, and Radical-Right Voting"](https://doi.org/10.1177/23780231241251714) in _Socius._

<br><br>I am an author of the book [_GoFailMe: The Unfulfilled Promise of Digital Crowdfunding_](https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=30793) (Stanford University Press). You can find an op-ed about this research in [_The Conversation._](https://theconversation.com/what-gofundme-conceals-the-campaigns-that-fail-234336)<br><br>'
